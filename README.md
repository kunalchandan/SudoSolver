# SudoSolver
Sudoku Solver created from scratch
You will need to feed a 9x9 " " space separated matrix for the program to solve.
As of right now it is not working. I believe I'm confusing sectors with grids somewhere in my code.
Should you want to run this yourself consider the following:
 - Change the relative path of reading the matrix
 - Remove the Thread.sleep in the Sudoku Class

In terms of my thought process, I originally intented on having sector objects that had grids. But it got very messy. I did not include this in this repository as I droped it within an hour of programming it.
